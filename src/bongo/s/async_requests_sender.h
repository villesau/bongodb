/**
 * The AsyncRequestsSender allows for sending requests to a set of remote shards in parallel and
 * automatically retrying on retriable errors according to a RetryPolicy. It can also allow for
 * retrieving partial results by ignoring shards that return errors.
 *
 * Work on remote nodes is accomplished by scheduling remote work in a TaskExecutor's event loop.
 *
 * Typical usage is:
 *
 * AsyncRequestsSender ars(txn, executor, db, requests, readPrefSetting);  // schedule the requests
 * auto responses = ars.waitForResponses(txn);  // wait for responses; retries on retriable erors
 *
 * Additionally, you can interrupt() (if you want waitForResponses() to wait for responses for
 * outstanding requests but stop scheduling retries) or kill() (if you want to cancel outstanding
 * requests) the ARS from another thread.
 *
 * Does not throw exceptions.
